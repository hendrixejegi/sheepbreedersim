# sheepbreedersim
The code models a simplified sheep breeding scenario, adhering to specific mating rules between Type A and Type B males, with provisions for cases where one type of male is absent.

The reproduction process follows specific rules: 
1. Type A males mate first as they produce two baby sheep when mating, 
2. Type B males mate after Type A males because they produce one baby sheep.
3. However, in the absence of Type A males, Type B males take precedence in mating

The program prompts the user to input the number of Type A males, Type B males, and female sheep. It then calculates the total population, tracks pregnant females, and records the number of newborns based on the mating rules. The output includes information on the number of fathers, pregnant females, newborns, and the total sheep population after the reproduction process.
